        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <i>I am a 2nd year student of CPC (Cordova Public College) taking the course of 
            BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology). I do like coding because 
            It's one of my interest to do about technology, since todays generation is more
            on high tech technologies. I hope that even if I don't have much skills to perform
            or to build codes and websites, I still want to graduate and finish my studies to 
            make myself proud and to my love ones.

        <h1>Project</h1>
        <i>This project is made by group, but since I was part of the group and how the 
            website is structured I can still call this as my project on the subject of
            Web Development. This project did take many weeks to make and to design, I am
            proud of what I did on my part of this website because I can and everyone 
            else can see my work. I am proud because even if I was a 1st year student before,
            I made it to 2nd year and I am still on going for this journey as a BSIT student.
